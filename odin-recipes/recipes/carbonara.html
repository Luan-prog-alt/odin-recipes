 <p>Carbonara</p>



 <p><em>Carbonara</em> is a pasta dish that originated in Italy and is made with eggs, cheese, cured pork, and pasta. </p>

 <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
 <p>
<ul>1 pound spaghetti</ul>

<ul>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</ul>

<ul>8 slices bacon, diced</ul>

<ul>1 onion, chopped</ul>

<ul>1 clove garlic, minced</ul>

<ul>¼ cup dry white wine</ul>

<ul>4 large eggs, beaten</ul>

<ul>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</ul>

<ul>salt and black pepper to taste</ul>

<ul>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</ul>

<ul>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
 </p>

 <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>

 <p><ol>
<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>

<li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>

<li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>

<li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>

<li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
